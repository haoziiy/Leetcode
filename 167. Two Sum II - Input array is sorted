/**************************************************************************************
 * Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, 
 * find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
 *
 * The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, 
 * where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
 *
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
 *
 * Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
 * Output: index1=1, index2=2
