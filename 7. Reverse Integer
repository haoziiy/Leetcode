 * Have you thought about this?
 * Here are some good questions to ask before coding. 
 * Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this! 
 *
 * If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100. 
 * 
 * Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer,
 * then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases? 
 * 
 * For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
 *
 * Note:
 * The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
